      <h3>Thoughtful Desing </h3>
      <p>There's a young creek streaming inside your cell,
        It will stop pulsating, will stop pulsating.
        Your life from the valleys of blooming lights -
        It won't happen anymore, won't happen any more.
        Time cannot be stopped (you know it),
        As long0as the blood keeps boiling. There's a young creek streaming inside your cell,
        It will stop pulsating, will stop pulsating.
        Your life from the valleys of blooming lights -

        Time cannot be stopped (you know it),
        As long as the blood keeps boiling. Show me the glorious faraway, that glorious faraway*,
        Where April shines and blooms, blooms, blooms, blooms.
        A road after a road, from a wellspring to the source,
        Where April shines and blooms, blooms, blooms, blooms. The wheel of tangled days is spinning faster.
        So what do you see in your dreams? What are your dreams?
        A house and a creek, where tender eyesight is yearning,
        It won't happen anymore, won't happen any more.
        Promise me you will never lose them again. Show me the glorious faraway, that glorious faraway,
        Where April shines and blooms, blooms, blooms, blooms.
